{{% /imgproc %}}

Click the **Setting** buttonï¼Œenter the user's information edit page, such as:

{{% /imgproc %}}

You can update the user's password, avator, login name and nickname in the page. 

## User session's limitation

By default, each account can have 2 sessions. The latest session will kick out the oldest session if the number of sessions exceeds the limitation. You can change the number of session limitations by modifying the chime-server's configuration file. Such as editing the /etc/chime/server.yaml file as follows:

```
chime-server:
  #the number of user sessions:
  user_sessions: 2
  ...
```

Then restart the chime-server to have the change take into effect:

```
systemctl restart chime-server 
```
