###  ChimeStack's HA Architecture Overview

In the production environment, The high-availability solution of ChimeStack is to clusterize its services in distributed nodes and introduce the "keepalived+LVS" component into the production for services' health check, automatic failover, and load balancing. So that when some components or services of ChimeStack are down, with the HA setting of keepalived+LVS, it will detect the failure and will failover to a healthy one in seconds, ChimeStack's overall supposed SLA is 99.5%.

Following is the summary of the HA solutions for ChimeStack's components

- chime-server: active-standby instances + keepalived(VIP) 
- chime-portal: active-active instances + keepalived(VIP) + LVS(load balancing)
- chime-agent: virtual machines' automatical migration in case of node's failure, implemented by ChimeStack.
- mysql: dual mysql instances of mutual master and slave + keepalived(VIP), or Percona cluster is an alternative solution  
- influxdb: active-active instances + chime-client dual writes + chime-server read from VIP endpoint+ keepalived(VIP)
- s3: minio's MNMD(Multiple-Node-Multiple-Drive) deployments

### HA requirements for deploying nodes

The simple formula for calculating the minimum nodes setting for a production environment: 
> m * server nodes + n * computing nodes (2<=m<=3, n>=1)

### High availability environment example
